## Description
This was my final project completed for [The Ultimate React Course 2023: React, Redux & More](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/) on Udemy. It is an administrative portal for a luxury cabin retreat. It features a simple and clear UI demonstrating cabins available, bookings made by guests, as well as a dashboard displaying analytics and check in/out features. Sample user login is available on the login page, feel free to explore the options available. It utilizes React Query, Context API, Styled Components, and react-router as well as a backend using Supabase.
